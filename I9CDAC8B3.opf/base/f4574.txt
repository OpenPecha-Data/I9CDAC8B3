Prayer for the Long Life of Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentsé Rinpoche
by Kyabjé Dilgo Khyentsé Rinpoche

om svasti
Oṃ svasti!1
tubten yongdzok ngadak khyentsé gar
Dance of wisdom and love, sovereign of the entire Buddhist teaching—
zabgyé lungtok chö kyi gyatso ché
The great Dharma-ocean of the transmission and realization of the profound and vast,
sen sam gompé wanggyur choktrul gyi
You have mastered through hearing, reflecting and meditating.
tukkyé kutsé trinlé tarchin shok
Supreme incarnation, may your aspirations be fulfilled, and may your life and activity be infinite.

The humble disciple Maṅgala Śrī Bhūti (Dilgo Khyentsé Rinpoche) made this prayer in the vajra
cave of Kurjé, which bears the imprint of Guru Rinpoche's body, in Bumthang in Bhutan, when
presenting an offering cloud of teachings from the Kama transmission of the Ancient Translation
tradition.

↑ Svasti is the Sanskrit word for peace, happiness and well-being.
