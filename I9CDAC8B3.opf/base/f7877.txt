Prayer for the Long Life of Alak Zenkar Rinpoche
by Alak Zenkar Rinpoche

chitar trulpé ku yi tsen dzin khen
Outwardly he bears the name of a nirmāṇakāya incarnation,
nangtar redok khoné rang pung khen
Inwardly he brings about his own ruin through hopes and fears,
sangwar chö nor dö tar yong wen khen
Secretly he is bereft of values, riches, pleasure and liberation—1
khyampo dombü lü dé sem kyi shok
May this vagabond beggar be physically well and mentally at ease!

When Tsewang Rigdzin-la, the old disciple, lifelong attendant and secretary of the sublime lord
of refuge Pewar Rinpoche, said that I should write a long-life prayer for myself based
on an honest account of my own condition, I, Tudeng Nima, wrote this on the first 'completion'
of the dark phase of the third month of the Water Tiger year.2 May virtue and excellence
abound!
